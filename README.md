# Healthy@NKU Script

Author: Will St. Onge

This script is made to fill out and submit the Health@NKU form that NKU made for the Fall 2020 semester because of COVID-19.
It doesn't run by itself so, you will need to schedule it yourself or manually run it.
Currently, only Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Edge are supported.

Instructions for use can be found in the header comments of each script.

If you find a bug, report it on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/WillStOnge/HealthyNKUScript/issues). Please include a copy of the log generated.
